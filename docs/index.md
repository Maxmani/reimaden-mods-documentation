## General Information

- The mod is currently only available for Fabric. Forge is not planned at this time.
- You might run into some... interesting design choices. This is my first big actual mod, so I'm still learning.
- The mod is still in early development. Expect bugs and incomplete features.
- I have taken inspiration from other Touhou mods, while trying to put my own spin on things.
- It's highly recommended to use JEI or similar mods to view recipes.
