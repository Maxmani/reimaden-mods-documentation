# Ritual Crafting

## How it works

Ritual crafting is a way to craft items in-world. It is a bit more complicated than normal crafting, but it allows for more complex recipes.

Ritual crafting is done by placing down a **Ritual Shrine** surrounded by as many **Onbashira** blocks as needed. The Onbashira blocks must be placed in a specific pattern, and the Ritual Shrine must be placed in the center of the pattern.

The outer circle must be placed one block higher than the inner circle. The bottom blocks of the outer circle don't matter.

Ingredients are placed on the Onbashira, and the recipe is activated by pressing USE on the Ritual Shrine.

## Onbashira

Each onbashira can hold one item. Items cannot be placed on an onbashira if the block above it is occupied.

Onbashira can be created by placing an **Onbashira Pillar** and pressing USE on it with a [lead](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lead) and a piece of [paper](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Paper) in your hands.
