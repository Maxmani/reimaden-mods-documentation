# Mobs

Arcadian Dream is going to feature many familiar mobs from the Touhou universe. This page lists all of the mobs that are currently in the mod, as well as their drops and spawn conditions.

## Monsters

**WIP**

### Fairies

Fairies are the most common type of mob in Arcadian Dream. They come in many[^1] different types, and spawn in many different biomes. They are also generally the weakest mobs in the mod, and are easy to defeat.

!!! note "Needs more work"

    The formatting could be better. Especially the drops.
    It will do for now.
