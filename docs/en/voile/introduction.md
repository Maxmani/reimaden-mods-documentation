# Welcome to the Voile Documentation

Voile is an addon for [Apoli](https://github.com/apace100/apoli), adding new [power types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types/power_types/) and [conditions](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types/entity_condition_types/) to further enhance your data-driven power needs.

The features in this mod used to be part of [Touhou Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/touhou-origins), but they have been moved to this one to make it easier to maintain and update, as well as to make it easier for other addon developers to use them without having to depend on Touhou Origins.
