This is the documentation for the Arcadian Dream mod for Minecraft. It is a work in progress, and will be updated as the project progresses.

Arcadian Dream is a mod based on the popular [Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki) series. It adds a variety of new items, blocks, mobs, and other content to the game.

Visit [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/arcadian-dream) or [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/arcadian-dream) to download the mod.

## General Information

- The mod is currently only available for Fabric. Forge is not planned at this time.
- You might run into some... interesting design choices. This is my first big actual mod, so I'm still learning.
- The mod is still in early development. Expect bugs and incomplete features.
- I have taken inspiration from other Touhou mods, while trying to put my own spin on things.
- It's highly recommended to use JEI or similar mods to view recipes.
